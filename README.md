## Assignment Tasks

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective: Analyze the provided datasets to uncover actionable business insights.

**Key Insights:
**
Top Products: Identified top 10 products contributing significantly to overall sales for inventory and marketing optimization.
High Revenue Categories: Electronics and Home Appliances are the most profitable categories, with recommendations for promotional campaigns on underperforming categories.
Customer Signup Trends: Steady growth with spikes during specific months, driven by seasonal campaigns.
Revenue by Region: Europe and North America lead in revenue contribution, with recommendations for targeted investments.
Regional Underperformance: Identified underperforming regions and suggested tailored campaigns to unlock untapped potential.

## 2. Lookalike Model
Objective: Develop a model to recommend three similar customers for any given customer based on profile and transaction data.

**Highlights:**

Utilized customer and product data for similarity scoring.
Top 3 lookalikes with similarity scores are provided for the first 20 customers (Lookalike.csv).

## 3. Customer Segmentation / Clustering
Objective: Segment customers into clusters using profile and transaction data for personalized marketing.

**Key Results:**

Optimal Clusters: Formed 5 clusters with distinct patterns.
Evaluation Metric: Achieved a Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI) of 1.06, indicating well-defined clusters.
Cluster Insights:
Cluster 0: High spending, frequent transactions, dominant in South America.
Cluster 1: Medium metrics, primarily in Asia.
Cluster 2: Low activity, high recency, dominant in Europe.
Cluster 3: Very high spending and frequency, dominant in South America.
Cluster 4: Medium-low activity, dominant in North America.
Visualization: PCA-reduced 2D plots show distinct cluster groupings.

## How to Use
Clone the repository.
Open the respective Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) for code and analyses.
Refer to the PDF files for summarized reports and business recommendations.
Lookalike recommendations can be found in the Lookalike.csv file.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates a data-driven approach to understanding customer behavior, optimizing marketing strategies, and improving overall business efficiency. By leveraging insights and models, businesses can enhance their strategic planning and drive growth.
